> ## &#128024; Description 
<p>A project that came up with the desire to make Arch Linux more accessible. It is a rework of the original site, keeping the main content in a more direct and modern way. This project is open to the community, so it is open to contributions to make it better and better.</p>

> ## &#128010; Technologies
<p>
The site was made with:
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ul>
No frameworks were used, everything was done manually :).
</p>

> ## &#9888;&#65039; Warning 
<p>This site has emerged as a personal project, but contributions are welcome. This is NOT the official Repository of Arch Linux, so the changes will not appear on the <a href="https://archlinux.org/">official website</a>.</p>
